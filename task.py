# Your task is to get the code from your friend
# copy the code of your friend, preferably as separate files to this repository
# Test all of the methods in their code, or at least 10 unittest tests (that make sense).
# Your test must be runnable with the command `python -m unittest task`
# Write down the address of your friends repo here:
# 
# Imported from: ADRESS_LINK_HERE
#

# change the name of OTHER_CODE, to the code that you imported
import OTHER_CODE
